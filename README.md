# Forge React App ![Build Status](https://github.com/ioanungurean/forge-react-app/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Forge React apps with no build configuration. (TypeScript or ECMAScript)

- [Creating an App](#creating-an-app) – How to create a new app.

Forge React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ioanungurean/forge-react-app/issues/new).

## Quick Overview
```sh
npx forge-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

### Get Started Immediately
You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App
**You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx
```sh
npx forge-react-app my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies.

```
my-app
│   .babelrc
│   .gitignore
│   package-lock.json
│   package.json
│
├───devtools
│       webpack.common.js
│       webpack.dev.js
│       webpack.prod.js
│       setUpTests.js
│
└───src
    │   index.js
    │   index.html
    │   App.js
    │
    ├───styles
    │       StyledApp.js
    │
    └───__tests__
            App.test.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.
